# BreezeApp Engine Runners

This directory contains the core components and implementations of AI Runners for the BreezeApp Engine.

AI Runners are modular components that encapsulate the logic for interacting with various AI models and services (e.g., Large Language Models, Automatic Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech, Vision-Language Models, and Guardian models). They provide a standardized interface for the BreezeApp Engine to discover, load, and execute AI capabilities, abstracting away the complexities of different AI backends.

## Getting Started with Runner Development

For a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to create, implement, and integrate your own AI Runners into the BreezeApp Engine, please refer to our main documentation:
