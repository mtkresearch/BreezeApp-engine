/**
 * Domain model representing the current state of the BreezeApp Engine Service.
 * 
 * This sealed class follows Clean Architecture principles by:
 * - Encapsulating state logic in the domain layer
 * - Providing type-safe state representation
 * - Abstracting UI concerns from business logic
 * 
 * Each state provides display information while maintaining separation of concerns.
 * States automatically determine their notification behavior, progress display,
 * and visual representation.
 * 
 * ## Usage Example
 * ```kotlin
 * when (val state = statusManager.getCurrentState()) {
 *     is ServiceState.Ready -> showReadyUI()
 *     is ServiceState.Processing -> showProgress(state.activeRequests)
 *     is ServiceState.Downloading -> showDownload(state.progress)
 *     is ServiceState.Error -> showError(state.message)
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * @see BreezeAppEngineStatusManager for state management
 * @see NotificationManager for notification integration
