# BreezeApp Engine Refactoring Progress Tracker

This document tracks our progress in refactoring the BreezeApp Engine codebase to follow Clean Architecture principles with minimal redundancy while keeping the codebase easy to extend.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ‚úÖ Created Unified Utility Class
- **Task**: Consolidate overlapping functionality from `AudioUtil`, `SherpaTtsConfigUtil`, and `AssetCopyUtil` into a single `EngineUtils` class
- **Status**: Completed
- **Files Modified**: 
  - Created `/src/main/java/com/mtkresearch/breezeapp/engine/util/EngineUtils.kt`
  - Created `/src/test/java/com/mtkresearch/breezeapp/engine/util/UnifiedEngineUtilsTest.kt`
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced code duplication across utility classes
  - Improved maintainability with a single point of access for common engine operations
  - Better organization with clear separation of concerns
  - Easier testing with comprehensive unit tests

### 2. ‚úÖ Verified Functionality
- **Task**: Ensure the unified utility class provides the same functionality as the separate utility classes
- **Status**: Completed
- **Tests Passed**: 
  - Core audio functionality (AudioTrack creation, PCM conversion)
  - TTS model configuration access
  - ASR sample rate retrieval
  - PCM16 extraction from raw bytes
  - Float to PCM16 conversion
  - Asset management functions
  - WAV utilities and diagnostics
- **Verification**: All tests passing, confirming no loss of functionality

## In Progress Tasks

### 3. üîÑ Refactor Service Components
- **Task**: Simplify service components by moving business logic to use cases
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Components Being Refactored**:
  - `BreezeAppEngineService` (Android Service responsibilities only)
  - `ServiceOrchestrator` (Component coordination)
  - `BreezeAppEngineCore` (Business logic coordination)
  - `AIEngineManager` (AI request processing)
- **Goals**:
  - Clear separation between Android Service lifecycle and business logic
  - Single responsibility for each component
  - Easy testing of business logic without Android dependencies
  - Consistent error handling across all components

### 4. üîÑ Consolidate Model Management
- **Task**: Simplify model management system by reducing the number of classes
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Components Being Consolidated**:
  - `ModelManagementCenter`
  - `ModelManager`
  - `ModelRegistry`
  - `ModelVersionStore`
- **Goals**:
  - Simplified model management with fewer classes
  - Clearer interfaces for model operations
  - Better integration with the unified utility class
  - Reduced complexity in model lifecycle management

### 5. üîÑ Improve Configuration Management
- **Task**: Create a more flexible configuration system
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Components Being Improved**:
  - `ConfigurationManager`
  - Configuration loading and validation
  - Dynamic configuration updates
- **Goals**:
  - Support both static and dynamic configuration
  - Better error handling for configuration issues
  - More flexible model registration and selection
  - Easier addition of new runners and models

## Upcoming Tasks

### 6. ‚è≥ Enhance Documentation
- **Task**: Add comprehensive documentation for the refactored architecture
- **Status**: Upcoming
- **Areas to Document**:
  - Overall architecture and component interactions
  - API usage guides for developers
  - Migration guides for existing code
  - Best practices for extending the system

### 7. ‚è≥ Optimize Permission Handling
- **Task**: Consolidate permission management into a single, coherent system
- **Status**: Upcoming
- **Components to Consolidate**:
  - `PermissionManager`
  - Permission checking and requesting
  - Audio focus management
  - Overlay permission handling
- **Goals**:
  - Unified permission management system
  - Better error handling for permission issues
  - More intuitive API for permission operations
  - Consistent behavior across different Android versions

### 8. ‚è≥ Add Comprehensive Testing
- **Task**: Add more comprehensive unit tests for critical components
- **Status**: Upcoming
- **Areas to Test**:
  - Error handling paths
  - Edge cases in audio processing
  - Model loading and unloading scenarios
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Resource cleanup and memory management
- **Goals**:
  - Higher test coverage for critical components
  - Better regression testing for future changes
  - More robust error handling verification
  - Performance benchmarking

## Key Benefits Achieved So Far

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now centralized in the `EngineUtils` class
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality only need to be made in one place
3. **Enhanced Consistency**: All components now follow the same patterns and conventions
4. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all utility functions
5. **Cleaner Implementations**: Individual components now focus only on their specific logic
6. **Easier Testing**: Common functionality can be tested once in the unified utility class
7. **Extensibility**: New functionality can easily be added to the unified utility class

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring service components to fully separate Android Service lifecycle from business logic
2. Consolidate model management components to reduce complexity
3. Improve configuration management for better flexibility
4. Add comprehensive documentation for the refactored architecture
5. Enhance testing coverage for critical components

This progress tracker will be updated as we continue the refactoring process to ensure we maintain clear visibility of our improvements and maintain a consistent direction toward our Clean Architecture goals.
