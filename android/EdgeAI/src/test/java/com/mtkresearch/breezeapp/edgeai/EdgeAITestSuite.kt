/**
 * EdgeAI SDK Test Suite
 * 
 * Comprehensive test suite that runs all critical tests for the EdgeAI SDK.
 * Organized by test categories for efficient execution and clear reporting.
 * 
 * As a Senior Android Architect, this test suite provides:
 * 1. Complete coverage of critical functionality
 * 2. Fast execution without Android dependencies
 * 3. Clear separation of concerns
 * 4. Professional testing standards
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Run entire suite: ./gradlew test
 * - Run specific category: ./gradlew test --tests="EdgeAIArchitecturalTest"
 * - Run in CI/CD: All tests are JVM-based and run without emulators

         * Test Categories and Their Purpose:
         * 
         * 1. EdgeAIArchitecturalTest
         *    - Tests architectural principles and patterns
         *    - Validates singleton behavior and state management
         *    - Ensures proper error handling hierarchy
         *    - Verifies simplified architecture benefits
         * 
         * 2. EdgeAIBusinessLogicTest
         *    - Tests core business logic and data processing
         *    - Validates request/response transformations
         *    - Ensures data integrity and validation rules
         *    - Tests edge cases and boundary conditions
         * 
         * 3. EdgeAIContractTest
         *    - Tests public API contracts and stability
         *    - Ensures OpenAI API compatibility
         *    - Validates backward compatibility
         *    - Tests integration contracts (AIDL, Parcelable)
         * 
         * 4. EdgeAIPerformanceTest
         *    - Tests performance characteristics under load
         *    - Validates thread safety and concurrency
         *    - Ensures memory efficiency and leak prevention
         *    - Stress tests and scalability validation

         * Test Execution Guidelines:
         * 
         * Fast Feedback Loop:
         * 1. Run EdgeAIArchitecturalTest first (fastest, core functionality)
         * 2. Run EdgeAIBusinessLogicTest (data validation and logic)
         * 3. Run EdgeAIContractTest (API compatibility)
         * 4. Run EdgeAIPerformanceTest last (most time-consuming)
         * 
         * CI/CD Integration:
         * - All tests are JVM-based (no Android dependencies)
         * - No emulators or devices required
         * - Fast execution suitable for pull request validation
         * - Comprehensive coverage for release validation
